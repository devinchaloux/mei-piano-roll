# Spool

🎹 A piano roll player for MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) files, packaged
for npm as `mei-piano-roll`. It reads an MEI file in the browser, draws its
notes as a piano roll, plays them with a choice of synths or sampled
instruments, makes still images of any bars, and lists anything in the file it
could not show faithfully.

## Status

**2026-10-10:** Spool is a public alpha at https://spool.devinchaloux.com. It
opens with a Renaissance motet from the CRIM Project, shows tempo in the beat
the meter names, opens a file from your computer or from a link, shares a file as a link or as
a player for any web page, and plays the sampled instruments from its own copy
of the recordings. The first reader works. It handles short, cleanly encoded
files.
On the MEI project's 617 sample files it reads everything without crashing, and
144 read with nothing left out; the rest report a gap (repeats, mid-piece
changes, notes without a length, a few ties it can't follow). Tied notes sound
once, as one long note, grace notes play just before their beat, and measured
tremolos play as the repeated notes they stand for. A file with
several instruments shows each in its own color, on one roll or one lane per
part, with mute, solo, a color and a sound for each, starting from the
instruments the file names. The composer, and the artist for a song, show
beside the title when the file names them. **2026-10-17:** a Notation button
swaps the roll for the music in traditional notation, on a paper background,
lighting each note as it sounds and scrolling with the playhead; Verovio
draws it, downloaded only when the button is first pressed. **2026-10-24:**
chord symbols show in a row over the roll, written with ♭ and ♯, and a button
adds a bass line that holds each chord's bass note, from C2 to B2; the notation view opens
at a smaller size and has its own zoom. Notes are named as the file spells
them (B♭4, not A#4), and every text color on the roll meets WCAG AA contrast.
Held sampled notes now sustain past the end of their recordings without a
click, on loop points Spool measures itself, and the notation view scrolls
smoothly with the playhead. Nothing is published to npm yet. **2026-11-06:**
each GitHub release carries the built package, so a page can install it by
its link (see "Install it in a page"). **2026-11-07:** looping plays
straight from the end back into the start, with no break.

## Install it in a page

Spool isn't on npm yet. Each [release](https://github.com/devinchaloux/spool/releases)
carries the built package; install it by its link, choosing the release you want:

```bash
npm install https://github.com/devinchaloux/spool/releases/download/v0.1.1/mei-piano-roll-0.1.1.tgz
```

Your page provides React 18 or later. Then:

```tsx
import { MeiPianoRoll } from 'mei-piano-roll'

<MeiPianoRoll src="/music/excerpt.mei" />
```

## Try it

Requires Node 22 or later.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the address it prints. The page opens Tomás Luis de Victoria's *O magnum
mysterium*, encoded by the [CRIM Project](https://crimproject.org/pieces/CRIM_Model_0052/)
(CC BY-NC 4.0; see `demo/public/files/LICENSE.md`). Open any `.mei` file, drop one on the page, or open one from a link. A file from
your computer stays in your browser. Three tabs show the **full player**,
**Share** (a link to the file, or a small player for a web page) and the
**image maker**, which saves any bars as SVG or PNG. The side panel sets the
theme and each part's color for all three, and sounds chosen in one player
carry over to the other.

The same demo is hosted on Vercel (`vercel.json`): `main` deploys it, and each
pull request gets its own preview link. To build it yourself:

```bash
npm run build:demo   # static site in dist-demo/
```

The build first downloads the sampled instruments (about 45 MB, once), with
loop points that let a held note sustain past its three-second recording, into
`demo/public/sounds/`, which git ignores, so the hosted demo plays them from
its own address (`npm run sounds` does only that step). The loop points are
measured from the recordings and kept in `demo/loops/`; after changing the
recordings' commit in `demo/sounds.json`, measure them again with
`npm run loops`, which needs [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).

## Share a file, or put it in a web page

Spool keeps nothing on a server, so sharing means putting the MEI file online
first, somewhere other sites may read it: a file in a GitHub repository, a
Dropbox share link, or your own site with cross-origin reads allowed
(`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`). Paste its address into **Share**, which gives:

- **a link** that opens the file in Spool with your theme, colors and sounds;
- **an embed**, an iframe for any web page, blog or course site that allows
  iframes:

```html
<iframe src="https://spool.devinchaloux.com/embed?src=https://example.org/song.mei&theme=paper"
  title="Song · Spool" width="100%" height="340" style="border: 0; border-radius: 10px"></iframe>
```

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src` | The file's address (required) |
| `theme` | `studio` (default), `paper`, `neon` or `ink` |
| `colors` | One color per part, as hex without `#`, comma-separated: `c00050,1f5fbf` |
| `sounds` | One sound per part, by id (see `SOUNDS`), comma-separated: `piano,acid-bass` |

The embed fills the iframe's height. Its expand button opens the file in
Spool. Options are never renamed once published, so an embed keeps working.
An embed chooses how the file is shown, not who can read it: anyone with the
address can download the file.

## Use it in a React page

```tsx
import { MeiPianoRoll } from 'mei-piano-roll'

<MeiPianoRoll src="/music/example.mei" />
// or, with the file's text already loaded:
<MeiPianoRoll meiText={xml} height={320} onLoad={(score) => console.log(score.warnings)} />
// in a page of text: a play button over the roll, a one-line caption with play/pause
<MeiPianoRoll src="/music/example.mei" variant="compact" />
```

| Prop | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src` / `meiText` | The MEI file, by address or as text |
| `openHref` | Compact player only: an address its expand button opens in a new tab, instead of opening the full player in place |
| `variant` | `"full"` (default): the roll with its controls underneath. `"compact"`: a play button over the roll and a caption line with play/pause, the title and the composer; it opens into the full player |
| `header` | Show the title line above the full player; default `true` |
| `notation` | Offer the Notation button, which shows the file in traditional notation, drawn by [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org) (LGPL-3.0, about 2.4 MB, downloaded the first time a listener presses it); default `true` |
| `view` | The view the player opens in: `"roll"` (default) or `"notation"` |
| `sound` | Starting sound for every part, by id (see `SOUNDS`); default each part's nearest sound to the instrument the file names, else the saw lead |
| `partSounds` | Starting sound for each part, by id, in score order; takes precedence over `sound` |
| `samplesUrl` | Where the sampled instruments are hosted: a folder of FluidR3 `<instrument>-mp3.js` files, and optionally `<instrument>-loop.json` loop points so held notes sustain, ending in `/`; default the volunteer-run site smplr uses (no loop points) |
| `onPartSoundsChange` | Called with every part's sound whenever the listener changes one, so a page can keep the choice |
| `theme` | `"studio"` (default), `"paper"`, `"neon"`, `"ink"`, or your own colors |
| `accent` | Note color (the first part's, with several); without it, the page's `--accent` CSS variable, then the theme's |
| `partColors` | One color per part, in score order; default the note color, then quick-pick colors |
| `separateParts` | Start with each part on its own roll; default `false` |
| `height`, `pxPerBeat`, `bpm` | Size, starting zoom, and a tempo override in quarter notes a minute (the player shows tempo in the beat a listener feels: half notes in 2/2, dotted quarters in 6/8) |
| `onLoad` | Called with the parsed score, warnings included |

Also exported: `NOTE_COLORS`, eight quick-pick note colors that adjust for
light and dark themes; `parseNative(xml)` for the note data without the player; and
`rollToSvg(score, options)` for still images (`partColors`, `separateParts` and
`fadedParts` match the player's view of several parts). Drawing needs no
browser, so a site's build can draw pictures straight from its files; reading
the MEI does need an XML parser, which Node lacks, so a build gives
`parseNative` one first, such as jsdom's `DOMParser` (the stress test does
this, in `stress/samples.stress.ts`).

Sampled instruments are FluidR3 GM by Frank Wen (CC BY 3.0), played by
[smplr](https://github.com/danigb/smplr); the player credits them whenever one
is in use.

## Checks

```bash
npm run lint && npm run test:run && npm run build
```

CI runs the same on every push. `npm run build` type-checks, then builds the
library into `dist/`.

## Stress test

```bash
npm run stress
```

Downloads the MEI project's sample files (about 113 MB, once) into `fixtures/`,
which git ignores, reads every one, and writes `fixtures/stress-report.md`. It
takes about two minutes. Its job is to show what breaks, not to pass; see
[`docs/fixtures.md`](docs/fixtures.md).

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/mei/` | The reader: MEI text in, note data and warnings out. No UI. |
| `src/roll/` | The player component (one canvas), its color themes, and the lane layout it shares with the images. |
| `src/audio/` | Sounds: the synth recipes, the sampled-instrument list, a part's starting sound, the engine that plays them. |
| `src/render/` | Still images: SVG from a score, and PNG in the browser. |
| `src/test/` | Unit tests, with short MEI snippets written for them. |
| `demo/` | The demo page (`npm run dev`); not part of the library. |
| `stress/` | The stress test (`npm run stress`). |
| `scripts/fetch-samples.mjs` | Downloads the sample files for the stress test. |
