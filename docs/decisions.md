# Decisions

**Status (2026-10-24):** Spool is a public alpha that opens a file from a
link and shares one as a link or an iframe embed, and plays the sampled
instruments from its own copy. The native reader works, and the player has a sound
picker, color themes, image export and several instruments in one roll, each
with its own color and sound, and a notation view drawn by Verovio, with its
own zoom. Tied notes sound once and grace notes play before their beat. The
composer and artist show when the file names them. Chord symbols show over
the roll, and can add a bass line.
**Next action:** the native reader's tuplets written as `@tuplet` or a
`<tupletSpan>`; annotations once their list is settled.

Each decision gets: date, the choice, the alternatives rejected, and why, so it
isn't re-litigated later. Entries are binding until a later entry reverses
them; don't edit an old entry, add a dated note beneath it.

## Decided

### 2026-10-07: two readers behind one renderer

**Choice.** A small reader of our own for clean, simply encoded files, and the
Verovio toolkit for everything else, loaded only when needed. Both hand the
renderer the same note data, so drawing and playback are written once.

**Rejected.**
- *Verovio only:* correct across the repertoire, but every embedding page
  downloads several megabytes.
- *Our own reader only:* no extra download, but it must solve ties, repeats,
  pickup bars, tempo and meter changes and transposing instruments itself, and
  an unhandled case would show as a confident but wrong roll.

**Why.** Verovio already solves the hard timing problems and reports them as
data. Loading it on demand keeps small embeds light. Comparing the two readers'
output on public-domain files turns "is the small reader right?" into a
measurement.

### 2026-10-07: packaged as a component, with a demo, for installation

**Choice.** A component built as a library, plus a one-page demo that opens any
MEI file, published for anyone to install (npm) once the repository is public.

**Rejected.** A standalone page only: nothing for other sites to embed.

**Why.** Other pages need to embed the roll, and a demo makes it easy to try.

### 2026-11-06: installed from a GitHub release until it is on npm

**Choice.** Publishing a GitHub release runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
which checks, builds and packs the library and attaches the package to the
release as `mei-piano-roll-<version>.tgz`. A page installs it by that file's
link. The release's tag must match `package.json`'s version (`v0.1.0` for
0.1.0), or the workflow stops.

**Rejected.** *Publishing to npm now:* it waits on a check of what Verovio's
license asks of a package that depends on it. *Copying the source into each
page that uses it:* every copy falls behind the next change, and the first
one already had (it lacked chord symbols and the bass line).

**Why.** A page can install the real, current package today, with its own
dependencies (smplr and verovio) installed alongside, and update by pointing
at a newer release. Moving to npm later changes only the line that names the
package.

### 2026-10-07: test files are fetched, never committed

**Choice.** The stress test reads the MEI project's sample encodings
(`music-encoding/sample-encodings`, ECL-2.0), MEI 3.0 to 5.1. A script
downloads them, pinned to one commit, into a folder git ignores, and runs
every file. Files whose headers carry a modern publisher's copyright are left
out. Unit tests use short MEI snippets written for the tests.

**Rejected.** Committing a sample (about 21 MB for the small files) or the
whole set (about 113 MB): it stays in the history for good, and the MEI
project's repository is already the maintained source.

**Why.** The point is to run the roll over every file as it is built and see
what breaks; the result table is what is worth keeping, not the files.

### 2026-10-07: the tools, matching the maintainer's other projects

**Choice.** React (a peer dependency, version 18 or later), Vite, TypeScript 5.9,
Vitest, ESLint with the TypeScript and React Hooks rules, and jsdom for tests
that need a browser's XML parser. CI on GitHub Actions runs lint, tests and the
build.

**Rejected.** TypeScript 7: newer, but the lint tooling is proven on 5.

**Why.** The same tools as the maintainer's other public project, so one set of
habits covers both. React is a peer dependency because the page embedding the
roll already has it; two copies of React on one page break hooks.

### 2026-10-07: the reader reports what it leaves out

**Choice.** Every reader returns `warnings` alongside the notes: one entry per
kind of gap (ties drawn as separate notes, pickup bars padded, a meter written
where the reader doesn't look, skipped elements…) with a count. The player lists
them under the roll. An unreadable duration now takes no time instead of
breaking the whole timeline.

**Rejected.** Failing silently, as the prototype did: a user can't tell a
limitation from a bug.

**Why.** It is the "say what the roll leaves out" design bet, made concrete, and
it lets the stress test count each gap across the sample files.

### 2026-10-07: the stress test gives each file its own simulated browser

**Choice.** The stress test reads files in plain Node, creating a fresh jsdom
window per file and closing it afterwards.

**Rejected.** One shared jsdom window: it keeps every document it has parsed
and ran out of memory (8 GB) partway through the samples.

**Why.** Memory stays flat (about 55 MB) whatever the number of files.

### 2026-10-07: the native reader reads MEI where modern files write it

**Choice.** The reader now:
- takes the opening meter from any staff, the score, a `<meterSig>`, or the
  header's description of the work, and each staff's opening key from the
  staff, the score, a `<keySig>` or MEI 3's `key.sig`;
- takes a chord's duration from its notes when the chord has none;
- keeps a bar flagged `metcon="false"` (meant to be short, such as a pickup) at
  its real length, and reports where every bar starts, so the player draws bar
  lines and numbers from the file instead of every N beats from zero;
- reads only `<music>`, never an incipit quoted in the header;
- follows `copyof` references, MEI's shorthand for repeated content.

**Rejected.** Leaving these to the second reader: they are a few lines each,
and files exported by notation software hit the first one constantly.

**Why.** The stress test measured them. On the 617 sample files, files read
with no warnings went from 0 to 35, wrong-meter warnings from 474 files to 8
(the 8 really have no opening meter), and padded short bars from 367 to 139.
An unflagged short bar is still padded and reported: it is more often an
encoding slip than a pickup.

### 2026-10-07: sounds: built-in synths first, sampled instruments on demand

**Choice.** A sound picker with two kinds of sound:
- **Synths** (12: square lead, saw lead, supersaw, pluck, rave stab, warm pad,
  acid bass, sub bass, chiptune, organ, FM bell, sine), built from the
  browser's own oscillators and filters as data recipes (`src/audio/synth.ts`).
  Nothing to download. The square lead, the prototype's sound, stays the
  default.
- **Sampled instruments** (15, including piano and trumpet), played by the
  `smplr` library (MIT) from the FluidR3 General MIDI recordings (CC BY 3.0,
  credited under the roll whenever one is in use). Each is downloaded, about
  2-3 MB, the first time it is chosen, and the library's own code loads only
  then too.

**Rejected.**
- *Synths only:* no real piano or trumpet.
- *The Musyng Kite recordings,* smplr's default: richer but under a share-alike
  license.
- *Tone.js:* five times the size, for features the roll doesn't need.

**Why.** The roll's first audience reads music as a producer does, so
electronic sounds come first and cost nothing; real instruments are there when
a piece needs them, and a page pays for them only when someone listens.

**Note (2026-10-24).** The default is now the saw lead, the maintainer's
choice ("default to the Saw lead in general even for the bass"): it is the
sound a part starts with when the file names no instrument the picker
matches. A part whose file names one still starts on its nearest match.

**Known risk.** The recordings are fetched from a single volunteer-run GitHub
site. Before the package is public, host a copy alongside it (smplr supports a
custom address).

**Note (2026-10-10).** The hosted demo now has its own copy; see "the hosted
demo plays the sampled instruments from its own copy". The library's default is
still the volunteer site, until the tool has its own address.

### 2026-10-07: color themes, and notes follow the page's accent

**Choice.** Four themes for the roll's surface (`src/roll/themes.ts`): studio
(the default, a dark DAW surface), paper (light), neon (high contrast) and ink
(grayscale, for print), or any set of colors passed in. The note color comes
from the `accent` prop, else the page's `--accent` CSS variable, followed live,
else the theme.

**Why.** Following the page's variable means a site's theme or accent switch
recolors the notes with no wrapper code; the prop and themes cover pages that
have no such variable.

### 2026-10-07: still images as SVG, made without a browser

**Choice.** `rollToSvg(score, options)` draws any range of bars as SVG text:
size, keyboard, bar numbers, note names, transparent background, theme and note
color are options. It needs no browser, so a site's build can draw pictures
straight from the excerpt files. `svgToPng` makes a PNG in the browser. The
player's Image button saves the bars in view; the demo page has a full image
maker.

**Rejected.** Exporting the canvas directly: canvas images are fixed-resolution
and need a browser.

**Why.** Pictures made from the real files can't drift from them, and SVG stays
sharp at any size.

**Note (2026-10-08).** "Needs no browser" holds for the drawing only.
Reading the MEI (`parseNative`) uses the browser's `DOMParser`, so a site's
build in Node must supply one, such as jsdom's, before it reads a file.

### 2026-10-08: the demo is hosted on Vercel, open to anyone

**Choice.** Vercel builds the demo page (`npm run build:demo`, settings in
`vercel.json`): `main` deploys it and every pull request gets a preview link.
The deployments are not locked down: anyone with a link can open them.

**Why.** Trying the roll, and hearing the sampled sounds, should not require
installing anything; previews let a change be heard before it merges. The demo
holds no private material (it plays a built-in scale or a file the viewer opens),
so there is nothing for a sign-in to protect.

### 2026-10-08: brief interface text, details in tooltips, American English

**Choice.** The player and the demo say only what a control does or what to do
next; reasons, limits and how-to hints go in tooltips; status text appears only
while something loads or fails. The rules are in `CLAUDE.md` ("Writing
interface text"). The project is written in American English throughout.

**Why.** Short text gets read; long text gets skipped, and the useful detail
goes with it. The first version explained itself on screen (a permanent line of
instructions under the roll, a download note in the sound menu).

### 2026-10-08: quick-pick note colors

**Choice.** `NOTE_COLORS` offers eight named colors (Magenta, Sky, Rose, Cyan,
Amber, Lime, Violet, Neutral), each with a bright strength for dark themes and
a deeper one for light themes, chosen automatically. Every built-in theme's own
note color is one of them. The demo shows them as swatches beside a custom
color picker.

**Why.** Picking a color should take one click, and a color chosen on a dark
theme should still read when the theme turns light.

### 2026-10-08: a transport that schedules just ahead

**Choice.** Playback goes through a transport (`src/audio/transport.ts`) that
hands notes to the sound engine about a tenth of a second before they sound,
on a 25 ms timer. Play, pause, stop, seek, tempo and loop are its methods, and
it is unit-tested with a fake clock. The player tracks the listener's intent
separately, so pressing play again while a sound downloads cancels instead of
starting a second playback, and picking another sound mid-download plays the
newest choice.

Switching sound cuts the old one off at once: each sampled instrument has its
own output level, faded to silence in about 20 ms when it is left, rather than
ringing on through its release under the new sound. A synth note is
disconnected as well as stopped when playback halts, because some browsers
refuse a second stop() on a sound that already has one scheduled.

**Rejected.** Scheduling the whole piece when play is pressed, as before. The
sample library queues notes scheduled far ahead and its stop() leaves that
queue alone, so pausing, or switching instrument, kept the old notes playing.

**Why.** It is how players stay responsive: nothing is committed further ahead
than the lookahead, so every control acts at once.

### 2026-10-08: two player layouts, and a studio page for the demo

**Choice.** The player comes in two layouts. The full player puts the controls
in one bar under the roll: back to start, play/pause, loop, the position as
bar and beat, then sound, tempo, zoom, image and the "not shown" list. The
compact player, for essays, shows the roll with one play button over it, a thin
progress line, and a caption with the title and sound; it opens into the full
player in place. The demo became a studio page: a side panel for the file and
the look, and tabs for the full player, the compact player and the image maker.
Only the open tab's player exists, so two can never play at once.

**Rejected.** Controls above the roll (the first version), which put a row of
settings between the title and the music; and a media-player bar with the
settings in a pop-up, which hid the sound and tempo that producers change most.
A separate Stop button: back to start and pause cover it.

**Why.** The roll is the point, so the controls sit under it, as in a DAW's
transport. Essays need the music without the machinery; the studio page is
where the machinery lives.

**Note (2026-10-08).** The compact player's caption now starts with a
play/pause button: the button over the roll disappears while it plays, and
clicking the roll moves the playhead, so a reader had no way to pause other
than the space bar.

### 2026-10-08: several instruments in one roll

**Choice.** Every note now carries a `part`, an index into the score's new
`parts` list (`src/mei/types.ts`). A part is one instrument:

- **What counts as a part.** Each staff is its own part, except that a staff
  group is read as one part when it is braced or names an instrument (a label,
  or an `<instrDef>`), and its staves don't name different instruments. A
  piano's two braced staves are one part; a bracket named "Violini" over two
  unnamed staves is one part. A name on a later staff alone (a viola staff
  named inside a group of violins) names only that staff, and the unnamed
  staves take the group's name. A group label that is a bare number doesn't
  count as a name. Parts with no notes are dropped, so every part listed can
  be heard.
- **Colors.** The first part takes the note color, so a one-part file looks
  as before; the others follow from the quick-pick colors, in an order that
  keeps neighbors apart, in the strength that suits the theme. `partColors`
  overrides them.
- **One roll or lanes.** All parts share one roll by default. A toggle gives
  each part its own lane, fitted to its own pitch range, labeled, and the
  player grows taller rather than squeeze a lane below 56 px, or a pitch row
  below 4 px (`MIN_ROW_HEIGHT`): a quartet's cello spans more than three
  octaves, and at 56 px its notes were slivers. The canvas and
  `rollToSvg` both lay out through `src/roll/lanes.ts`, so a saved image
  matches the screen.
- **Mute, solo and a sound per part.** Each part has its own audio channel.
  Mute and solo set its level, so they act at once, even on notes already
  sounding; a muted part stays on the roll, faded. Solo plays only soloed
  parts, and a muted part stays silent either way. Each part has its own copy
  of a sampled instrument, so switching one part's sound never cuts another.
  The overall level comes down as parts are added (1/√n), so a full score
  doesn't clip.
- **Starting sounds.** A part starts with the nearest sound to the instrument
  the file names: by General MIDI program when an `<instrDef>` gives one,
  else by words in its name, in English, Italian and German
  (`src/audio/instruments.ts`). A staff with no name of its own takes one from
  the header's performer list (`<perfRes n="1">Violin I</perfRes>`), but only
  when that list numbers exactly the score's staves, so a list of another shape
  never names the wrong staff. "Bass" alone matches nothing (a voice or a
  double bass). A `sound` prop sets every part's starting sound instead.

**Rejected.**
- *A part per staff and layer,* as the architecture notes first suggested:
  two voices on one staff are one instrument, and splitting them would give a
  violin two mute buttons.
- *One sampled instrument shared by every part that uses it:* it has one
  output, so muting one part, or switching its sound, would either silence the
  others or leave the old sound ringing through its release. The cost of a
  copy per part is memory and a short decode when two parts pick the same
  instrument.
- *Mute by not scheduling notes:* a note already handed to the engine would
  play on.

**Why.** The roll's first audience reads music as a producer does, and
mute, solo and a color per track are how a DAW shows several instruments.
Lanes are not decoration: a wide score on one roll leaves a few pixels per
semitone. On the 617 sample files, 310 read as more than one part, and the
stress test's totals did not change.

### 2026-10-08: tied notes sound once, as one note

**Choice.** A tied chain becomes one note on the roll, as long as the whole
chain, and it sounds once. The reader finds a tie from a `<tie>` element (by
the notes it names, or, if it names only one end, the note of the same pitch
in the same part that meets it) or from a note marked `tie="i"` or `"m"`,
which continues into the next note of the same pitch in the same part,
starting where it ends. A chord's `tie` applies to each of its notes. A tie
whose other end can't be found is reported, and its notes play as written.

**Rejected.**
- *One long note with a faint line where the written notes meet:* the bar
  lines already show where they fall.
- *Two notes drawn, played as one sound:* the roll would show two attacks
  where one is heard.

**Why.** A tie is one sound, and a piano roll shows sounds, as a recording or
MIDI file would. Ties were the most common gap in the sample files (322 files);
after this, 64 still report a tie the reader can't follow, mostly where the
encoding marks a tie with no matching note after it.

### 2026-10-08: grace notes play just before the beat

**Choice.** A grace note plays just before the note it leads into, taking its
time from the note before, so the beat stays where it is written. It takes its
written length, but a run of grace notes takes at most half the time since the
note before, so that note is never swallowed. A grace note with no written
length, or with no time before it (at the very start of a part), is left out
and reported. All grace notes are placed this way, including those MEI marks
as accented (`grace="acc"`), which some performers play on the beat.

**Rejected.**
- *Leaving them off,* as before: the roll would drop notes that are heard.
- *On the beat, taking time from the main note:* it moves the written beat.

**Why.** It is how playback software usually performs them. Grace notes were
left out of 168 sample files; after this, 21 still report one it can't place.
With ties and grace notes handled, the files read with nothing left out went
from 35 to 144 of 617.

### 2026-10-08: tremolos play as the notes they stand for

**Choice.** A measured tremolo is shorthand for repeated notes, so the reader
writes them out: a `<bTrem>` repeats its note or chord, a `<fTrem>` alternates
between its two, each stroke one unit long, and the whole lasts as long as one
written note. The unit is `@unitdur` (or MEI 3's `@measperf`), else what the
slashes through a stem or the beams between a pair mean: one slash through a
quarter means eighths. A stated unit no shorter than the note can't be right
(one sample file gives a whole note for a dotted quarter), so the next source
is tried. A tremolo with no unit at all is unmeasured, "as fast as possible",
and plays held, with a warning. A tie out of a tremolo leaves from its last
stroke.

**Rejected.** Reading a tremolo as a plain container, as before: a `<bTrem>`
became one held chord, and a `<fTrem>` played both its notes at full length,
one after the other, pushing the rest of the bar late.

**Why.** The maintainer asked for Erlkönig's tremolo to read properly
(2026-10-08): its piano part is repeated triplet chords, written as tremolos,
and the roll showed one held chord per beat.

### 2026-10-08: more string sounds, and the metronome mark as a tempo

**Choice.** Viola, double bass and pizzicato strings join the sampled
instruments, and General MIDI programs and instrument names map to them
("Viola", "Bratsche", "Kontrabass", "pizz."). The tempo comes from `midi.bpm`
first, then from the metronome mark (`mm`, counted in `mm.unit`, so a dotted
quarter at 60 is 90 quarter notes a minute), then 120.

**Why.** A string quartet played a viola part on a violin and a cello part on
the default synth. Many files give only the metronome mark, and played at 120
regardless.

### 2026-10-08: a color for each part, and the embed keeps the chosen sounds

**Choice.** The demo's side panel lists the parts of a file with several; the
color picker sets the color of the part selected there, for all three tabs.
The demo remembers the sound chosen for each part in either player, so the
essay embed plays what the full player was set to, and the embed's tab shows
the code for an embed set up that way (theme, colors and sounds; defaults left
out, so a page's own accent still colors the notes unless one was chosen). The
player takes a `partSounds` prop, a starting sound for each part, and reports
changes through `onPartSoundsChange`.

**Rejected.** Picking colors inside the player itself: the colors are part of
how an excerpt is presented, set once by whoever embeds it, like the theme;
listeners change sounds, so those stay in the player.

**Why.** An essay's excerpt is set up in the studio page and then embedded;
without a way to carry the choices over, every embed played the file's
suggested sounds in the default colors.

**Note (2026-10-10).** The embed's tab is now **Share**, and its code is an
iframe anyone can paste, not React code; see "sharing a file by its address".

### 2026-10-08: the composer and artist, as the file names them

**Choice.** The reader returns `composer` and a new `artist` (a performer or
band, for a song), and the players show them beside the title. It finds a
composer in a `<composer>` element (MEI 3 and 4), a `<creator>` with a role
(MEI 5), or a name with a role (`<persName role="composer">`), with roles in
words or as MARC relator codes (`cmp`); an artist by the roles `artist`,
`performer` or `prf`, on a person's or a group's name (`<corpName>`, for a
band). It looks in the header first. Names listed together are joined; the
same person named again elsewhere in the header (in a source description,
often spelled differently) is not.

**Rejected.** Every credited name in the header: a file often credits its
encoder, editor and publisher, and names the composer twice.

**Why.** Before, only `<persName role="composer">` was read, and the demo
didn't show it at all. On the 617 sample files, a composer is now found in 420
(from 390), and no file lost one; the gain is files that use only `<composer>`.

### 2026-10-10: the hosted demo is a public alpha

**Choice.** The hosted demo is shared publicly as a tool anyone can open an MEI
file in, as Verovio offers its online viewer. It is labeled **Alpha** beside
its title, with a tooltip saying it changes often and lists what it leaves
out. Phones are not a target.

**Why.** The maintainer wants to share the public version of the tool
(2026-10-10). "Alpha" sets expectations: the reader handles cleanly encoded
files, and on the sample files most still report a gap.

**Note (2026-10-10).** The tool is named **Spool**, after the spool a piano
roll is wound on, and is to be hosted at `spool.devinchaloux.com`. The package
keeps the name `mei-piano-roll`, which says what it is to someone searching npm.
The repository was renamed from `mei-piano-roll` to `spool` the same day; GitHub
redirects the old address.

### 2026-10-10: the hosted demo plays the sampled instruments from its own copy

**Choice.** When the demo builds (`npm run build:demo`), `scripts/fetch-sounds.mjs`
downloads the recordings of every sampled instrument the player offers, read
from `src/audio/sounds.ts`, into `demo/public/sounds/`, which git ignores. The
source is the FluidR3 set as rendered by `gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts`, pinned to
one commit in `demo/sounds.json`; the folder is named after that commit, so
its files never change and browsers cache them for a year. MP3 only: every
browser decodes it, and it halves the copy, to about 45 MB. A `CREDITS.txt`
beside them carries the CC BY credit and license. The player takes a new
`samplesUrl` prop for a hosted copy; the demo sets it in its built version
only, so `npm run dev` still uses the volunteer site.

**Rejected.**
- *Committing the files:* about 45 MB (95 MB with the second format) in the
  history for good, in every clone.
- *Vercel Blob storage:* durable, but a second service on the maintainer's
  account to look after, and an upload step outside the repo.

**Why.** Listeners no longer depend on a volunteer-run site. Nothing large
enters git. If the source ever disappears, the next build fails loudly, the
live demo keeps its copy, and that copy is the place to move the files from
(to Blob storage, say) by changing one setting.

**Still open.** The library's own default stays the volunteer site. Once the
tool has a lasting address, the default could point at its copy, which would
then need a cross-origin header so other sites can read it.

### 2026-10-10: sharing a file by its address: a link, and an iframe embed

**Choice.** Spool can open a file from its address (**Open from a link**, or
`?src=` in Spool's own address), and **Share** turns a file that is online into
two things: a link that opens it in Spool with the theme, colors and sounds
chosen, and an iframe embed (`/embed`, the compact player alone) for any web
page. Both name the file's address and the settings in the query (`src`,
`theme`, `colors`, `sounds`); Spool stores nothing. A GitHub file page or a
Dropbox share link is turned into the file's raw address. In the embed, the
expand button opens the file in Spool in a new tab (`openHref`), and a light
theme gets light chrome. Embed options are never renamed once published.

**Rejected.**
- *React code to paste,* as the embed's tab gave before: only a developer who
  installs the package can use it, and nothing is on npm yet.
- *A web component* (a script tag and a custom element): it reads the host
  page's own files with no cross-origin setup, but many blog, course and site
  builders strip scripts and allow iframes. It can come later.
- *Uploading the file to Spool:* a server, storage and accounts for something a
  link already does.

**Why.** Spool is shared as a public tool for people who will mostly never
install anything; an iframe works in nearly every page that allows embeds, and
it is how Strata's embeds already work, so the two tools behave alike. The cost
is that the file's host must let other sites read it, which GitHub and Dropbox
do.

### 2026-10-10: a "Report an issue" link

**Choice.** The studio page's side panel links to the repository's new-issue
form, for bugs and suggestions.

**Why.** A public tool needs one obvious place for feedback.

### 2026-10-10: the demo opens with a CRIM Project motet, kept in this repository

**Choice.** Spool opens Tomás Luis de Victoria's *O magnum mysterium* as
encoded by the CRIM Project (Citations: The Renaissance Imitation Mass
Project), credited under the file's name with a link to its CRIM page. The
file is committed unchanged at `demo/public/files/CRIM_Model_0052.mei`, with
its credit and license in `LICENSE.md` beside it, and served from Spool's own
address. If it can't be read, the built-in two-part example opens instead.

This is the one exception to "no MEI files are committed" (2026-10-07). That
rule keeps encodings of unclear origin and license out of a public history;
this file's origin and license are stated in its own header.

**License.** CC BY-NC 4.0: free to share and adapt with credit, not for
commercial use. It is not covered by Spool's MIT license; anyone reusing
Spool commercially leaves it out. The library package never includes it.

**Rejected.** *Reading it from the CRIM Project's repository by address:* no
copy here, but the demo would break if that file moved or the site went down.

**Why.** A real four-voice piece shows what Spool is for, parts, colors and
sounds included, better than a scale; it reads with nothing left out.

### 2026-10-10: tempo is shown in the beat the meter names

**Choice.** The tempo box and the small player's caption count the beat a
listener feels: the note the meter's lower number names (half notes in 2/2,
quarter notes in 4/4), except in compound meters (6/8, 9/8, 12/8 and other
counts divisible by three over an eighth or shorter), which count the dotted
beat: dotted quarters in 6/8 (`src/roll/tempo.ts`). The tooltip names the
unit. 6/4 still counts quarters. Inside, tempo stays in quarter notes a
minute, as MIDI and the transport count it, and the `bpm` prop is in quarter
notes too.

**Rejected.** Quarter notes for every meter, as before: 2/2 read as 120 where
a musician counts 60.

**Why.** The maintainer asked for it: a tempo should read in the beat a
musician feels, the half note in 2/2 and the dotted quarter in 6/8.

### 2026-10-10: held notes sustain: loop points beside the recordings

**Choice.** Each sampled note is a recording about three seconds long, so a
note held longer went silent before it ended: in the default motet, the
altus's held D in bars 9 and 10 cut out. The demo's build now copies loop
points for each recording (where in it to repeat while a note is held) beside
the recordings, and the player passes them to the sample player, which loops
that stretch until the note ends. They come from
`goldst/midi-js-soundfonts`, worked out from the same FluidR3 soundfont,
pinned to one commit in `demo/sounds.json`. That repository names a few
instruments after the soundfont's presets, so the file maps them (the choir is
`ahh_choir`). Fourteen of the eighteen instruments have loop points; the
piano, electric piano, nylon guitar and pizzicato strings play their
recording once, as they die away within it anyway.

**Rejected.**
- *Re-sounding a long note every three seconds:* an audible new attack in
  the middle of a held note.
- *The sample library's own loop lookup:* it asks another site by General
  MIDI name, which misses the choir and the strings, and the demo would depend
  on that site.

**Why.** Long notes are the norm in the default file and in much vocal music;
a note must sound for as long as it is written. Measured in a browser: a
held choir note fell silent at about three seconds without loop points and
kept its level past five seconds with them.

**Still open.** Pages that use the library without a hosted copy
(`samplesUrl`) get no loop points, so their long sampled notes still stop at
the recording's end.

**Note (2026-10-24).** Three instruments' loop points were wrong for these
recordings: the synth bass, the clarinet and the vibraphone loop a single
cycle of the soundfont's raw sample, 1 to 9 ms long (the synth bass loops
samples 8 to 408 of every note). The recordings are rendered note by note, so
that stretch is a sliver of the attack: rendered offline through smplr, a held
F1 on the synth bass came out as a 110 Hz buzz, the same for every note,
instead of 43.7 Hz. The maintainer heard it on the bass line ("they sound
wrong"). The build now drops any loop shorter than 4410 samples (0.1 s;
`loops.shortest` in `demo/sounds.json`), which removes every loop of those
three and none of the others (the shortest kept is the trumpet's, 152 ms).
They play their recording once, about three seconds, like the piano. The
hosted copy's folder name carries the limit, so browsers holding the old loop
files for a year fetch the new ones.

**Note (2026-10-24, later).** Superseded by "loop points measured from the
recordings": none of goldst's loops fit these recordings, so Spool now
measures its own, for every note of every instrument.

### 2026-10-17: Verovio draws notation; it doesn't read the timing

**Choice.** Verovio is used for what it is built for: engraving the file as
notation, a view the listener can switch to. The piano roll stays the
default, and the native reader stays the only reader: it times every note,
for the roll and the notation alike. This reverses "two readers behind one
renderer" (2026-10-07) as far as Verovio is concerned.

**Rejected.** *A second reader on Verovio's timing.* It was built and
measured on the 617 sample files (branch `claude/sharp-einstein-fjxhrb`, its
first four commits). Verovio's timing layer had to be worked around at every
turn: the pitches it reports ignore the key signature and transposition; it
places grace notes inconsistently, mistimes `copyof` copies and chords whose
length is written on their notes, plays only the first `<mdiv>` unless asked,
and doesn't play out repeats with endings. Those are Verovio's to fix, not
this project's. Spool's own files, short and cleanly encoded, read correctly
with the native reader.

**The notation view.** A Notation button, in both layouts, swaps the roll
for the file engraved by Verovio as one long line of music
(`src/notation/`). It is lit and followed by the same playhead: each frame,
the notes sounding are colored in their part's color, and the view scrolls to
keep them about 38% across, as the roll does; clicking a note moves the
playhead there. Notes are matched by xml:id: the reader records each sound's
written notes (`MeiNote.ids`, all of a tied chain), Verovio keeps the file's
ids, and a note the file gives no id gets one (`spool-note-N`, in document
order) before either reads it. Notation is always on paper, the paper
theme's background with near-black ink, whatever the roll's theme; part
colors take their light-theme strength there. The SVG is scaled to the
player's height, at most twice Verovio's size, so a one-line tune reads
large and a four-part score fits. Verovio's SVG keeps only drawing before it
joins the page (no scripts, event attributes or outside links), since the
file can come from anyone's link. The roll's zoom, lanes and image controls
hide while notation shows. `notation` (default true) offers the button;
`view` opens on either.

**Why.** The maintainer wants listeners to an anthem on a page to be able
to read it as notation, with the roll as the default (2026-10-17).
Notation is read as printed music, hence paper (the maintainer's call,
2026-10-17).

**Note (2026-10-24).** Fitting the notation to the player's height made a
one-line tune twice Verovio's size, far too large (the maintainer, on a lead
sheet). It now opens at Verovio's own size, shrunk only to fit a score taller
than the player, and the zoom buttons work in the notation view too, from 0.4
to 3 times that size; the roll and the notation keep separate zooms. A zoom
keeps the same music in the middle of the view.

**Note (2026-10-24, scrolling).** Following the playhead was "way way way too
choppy" (the maintainer). The view aimed at the leftmost note sounding, so
its target leapt at each new note and stood still through rests, and it eased
a fifth of the way there each frame, in whole pixels: measured on a 40-bar
lead sheet, 120 of 358 frames didn't move and steps reached 10 px. Now the
playhead's place along the line is interpolated between the notes' onsets,
so it moves continuously; the view eases a quarter of the way toward it each
frame, which evens out uneven note spacing and the audio clock's small jumps;
and it scrolls to the whole pixel below its position and shifts the music the
rest of the way with a transform, so it moves less than a pixel when it
should. Measured the same way: every frame moves, steps stay under 3.4 px,
and the speed varies 17% from frame to frame (97% before), in a headless
browser whose frames themselves came 9 to 55 ms apart. Scrolling by hand
clears the shift and pauses following for 1.5 s, as before.

**Kept from it.** The comparison found gaps in the native reader: it skipped
octave lines without a word (it now reports them), and it ignores tuplets
written as `@tuplet` attributes or as a `<tupletSpan>` beside the layer,
silently, so those bars run long (Brahms's quartet and Debussy's *Golliwogg's
Cakewalk* among the samples; not fixed yet).

### 2026-10-24: chord symbols, and a bass line from them

**Choice.** The reader returns the file's chord symbols (`<harm>`) as
`chords`, each placed by the note it points at (`startid`) or its beat in the
bar (`tstamp`). The player shows them in a row under the bar numbers, each
clipped to the room before the next; saved images draw them too
(`chordSymbols`, default on). A `<harm>` holding figured bass (`<fb>`) is
reported, not shown. The maintainer's choices (2026-10-24):

- **Flat and sharp signs.** MuseScore exports a symbol as the text it was typed
  as ("Eb"), though it shows E♭ on screen. Spool shows ♭ and ♯ on the roll, in
  images and in notation, as it would be printed: a `b` or `#` straight after
  a pitch letter, or before a number ("B♭m7♭5"), becomes a sign; the b in
  "sus" or "dim" stays. Only the display changes: `text` keeps the file's
  words, and the notation view draws from a copy of the file with the signs
  written in (`withPrettyChords`).
- **A bass line, on request.** A button in the full player (and the
  `bassLine` prop) adds a part named "Bass from chords" that plays each
  chord's bass note, held until the next symbol (or the end), in a bass
  guitar's bottom octave, E1 to D♯2. A slash chord plays the note after the
  slash (E for C/E). "N.C." rests; a symbol it can't read rests and is
  reported. The part is marked `generated`, says in its tooltip that it isn't
  in the file, has its own color, mute, solo and sound, and lights its chord
  symbol in the notation view. It starts on the sampled synth bass: the synth
  basses sound an octave below the written note, too low for this register.
  Turning it on or off keeps the playhead and playback.
- **What counts as a flat.** One MEI sample (Parker and Gillespie's *Shaw
  'Nuff*) writes flats with the music symbol 𝄬, and puts optional chords in
  parentheses; both are read.

**Rejected.**
- *Fixing the text in the file:* MEI is the source of truth, and the tool
  never rewrites it. The export is MuseScore's to fix.
- *A root on every beat, or on every downbeat:* a held note is the plainest
  reading of the harmony, and leaves the rhythm to the melody.
- *The root under a slash chord:* a bassist reads C/E as asking for an E.
- *An octave under the lowest written note:* it would move from piece to
  piece; a fixed bass register reads as a bass part.

**Note (2026-10-24, later).** Chord symbols were too faint, in the roll's
muted text at 12 px. They now take a new strongest text color (`textStrong`,
see "text contrast, as the site holds it"), bold at 13 px in a 24 px row, and
the chord under the playhead takes the playhead's color, so the chord sounding
is the one lit. The bass line's notes are named as their symbol spells them
(E♭2 under "Eb"), as written notes now are ("note names as the file spells
them"). The synth bass the bass line starts on played every note as the same
buzz until its loop points were dropped (see the note under "held notes
sustain"); it now plays each recording once, about three seconds, so a chord
held longer goes quiet before it changes.

**Note (2026-10-24, register).** The bass line now sits from C2 to B2, an
octave up: from E1 to D♯2, the maintainer found it too low (in *Scary
Monsters and Nice Sprites* the F and Gm chords played F1 and G1; they now
play F2 and G2). It no longer names an instrument (it named General MIDI 38,
Synth Bass 1), so it starts on the default sound, the saw lead, as the
maintainer asked.

**Why.** The maintainer's lead sheets carry chord symbols, and a producer
reads a lead sheet as harmony and a bass line as much as a melody
(2026-10-24). On the 617 sample files the stress test changed only by the new
figured-bass report (16 files; files read with no warnings went from 140 to
139); every chord symbol in the four sample lead sheets reads.

### 2026-10-24: note names as the file spells them

**Choice.** A note's name on the roll and in images is spelled as the file
writes it: its letter, its accidental (written, else sounding, else from the
key signature) as a sign, and its written octave. A B flat is "B♭4", not
"A#4"; a C flat written in octave 4 is "C♭4", though it sounds as B3; a double
sharp is "F♯♯4". The keyboard's octave names (C4) are unchanged: no file
spells them.

**Rejected.** *Sharps for every black key,* as before: in a flat key every
accidental read wrong (the maintainer, 2026-10-24: "the note names … should
have the correct note name as it appears in the MEI file").

**Why.** The roll is derived from the encoding; a name the file doesn't use
misreports it. Signs match the chord symbols ("one idea, one wording").

### 2026-10-24: text contrast, as the site holds it

**Choice.** Text on the roll is held to WCAG AA for normal text (4.5:1)
against the worst background it is drawn on, as devinchaloux-site holds its
own palette (its `check:contrast`); `src/test/contrast.test.ts` checks every
built-in theme. Following the site's lift of 2026-10-14 (its body text was
"too dark", the look "too muted"):

- **Lighter text.** Studio's text (bar numbers, octave names, lane labels)
  goes from `#8b95ad` to the site's lifted muted `#b9bfcc`; neon's from
  `#7f89c9` to `#a9b2e6`. Paper and ink already matched the site's light text.
- **A strongest step.** Themes gain `textStrong` (optional for custom themes;
  it falls back to `text`), for the chord symbols: the site's `#eef0f4` in
  studio, `#0e0f14` on paper, white on neon, black in ink.
- **Note names that read on their note.** White on the bright note colors
  measured 1.8 to 2.9:1. A note's name now takes the theme's `noteText` where
  that reaches 4.5:1, else near-black or white, whichever reads better
  (`inkOn`): dark ink on bright notes, as the site puts dark ink on a filled
  accent.
- **The demo's chrome** used the site's palette from before the lift; it now
  copies the lifted values (`demo/site.ts`), and the player's fallback colors
  for a page with no palette of its own follow them too.

**Rejected.** *Lighter backgrounds for contrast:* the site found the problem
was text too dim, not a ground too dark; it darkened its ground.

**Why.** The maintainer asked for chord symbols that stand out and pointed to
the site's accessibility work (2026-10-24); the same faint grey ran through
the roll.

### 2026-10-24: loop points measured from the recordings

**Choice.** Spool measures its own loop points from the recordings it plays
(`scripts/make-loops.mjs`, `npm run loops`), for every note of all eighteen
sampled instruments, and keeps them in `demo/loops/`; the sounds build copies
them beside the recordings and fails if one is missing. For each note it
looks near the end of the recording for a stretch of 0.3 to 1.2 s whose two
ends are rising zero crossings a whole number of the note's cycles apart, and
picks the pair whose audio matches best across the seam, in shape and in
level. The hosted folder is named after the recordings' commit and the loops'
version (`loops.version` in `demo/sounds.json`), which the script raises when
any loop changes, so browsers fetch new ones.

**Why.** A note held past its recording (about 3.14 s) clicked: the maintainer
heard "a clipping sound if it needs to extend". Every recording is cut off at
3.14 s, with sustained instruments still at 20 to 40% of their peak, so an
instrument with no loop stopped dead; and goldst's loops, measured on the
soundfont's raw samples, don't fit recordings rendered at each pitch: across
the seam the audio was unrelated (a mismatch of 1 to 2, where 0 is seamless),
and some ran past the recording's end. With the new loops the median mismatch
is 0.01 to 0.1 for solo instruments, and 0.2 to 0.6 for ensembles (brass
section, strings, choir), whose detuned voices never quite repeat, and the
piano, quiet by then. Rendered offline through smplr, 6-second notes now hold
their pitch past 3.2 s, and the largest jump in slope after it is 1.1 to 2.9
times the usual one, against 4.5 to 25 times with goldst's loops; the synth
bass, clarinet and piano, which had none, no longer stop.

**Rejected.**
- *goldst's loop points,* filtered or not (see the notes under "held notes
  sustain").
- *Measuring loops in the listener's browser* as the recordings load: no
  tool needed, but every page would decode each instrument twice.
- *A fade at the recording's end:* no click, but the note stops early.

**Needs ffmpeg, only to measure them again.** The script decodes the MP3s
with ffmpeg, which the maintainer runs locally, and only when the recordings'
commit changes. The build reads the measured loops from the repository and
needs nothing new. The loop points are numbers Spool measured, committed with
the code; the recordings stay out of the history.

### 2026-11-06: a page names the excerpt, and the roll fits its width

**Choice.** A page can pass `title`, which the title line shows in place of
the file's own title. With no `pxPerBeat`, the roll opens with the whole file
fitted to its width, within the zoom's range (28 to 160 px per beat); a long
file opens at the least zoom and scrolls. The title line no longer counts the
notes: it shows the parts (when there are several), the meter and the bars.

**Rejected.** *Reading the title from the file only:* exports often leave a
placeholder there (a notation program's default name for a movement). *A
fixed default zoom:* a short excerpt filled a third of the roll and a long one
ran off the edge.

**Why.** A page showing excerpts knows what each one is called, and a reader
takes in a short excerpt best when it is all in view. The note count told a
reader nothing they could use.

### 2026-11-07: a short excerpt fits a phone, and the title wraps

**Choice.** The zoom's floor drops to 12 px per beat, so a four-bar excerpt
fits a roll on a phone. A file that would need less than 12 to fit still
opens at 28 and scrolls, as before (`fitZoom` in `src/roll/zoom.ts`). The
title line wraps onto more lines on a narrow roll instead of cutting the
title short; the compact player's one-line caption still shortens it.

**Rejected.** *Lowering the floor for every file:* a long file opened at 12
px per beat is too dense to read at first sight. *Shortening the title:* on a
phone it cut a long title to a few letters.

**Why.** On a 390 px phone the roll showed two and a half of an excerpt's
four bars, with a long title cut short.

## Open questions

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| How is the roll drawn, and how does it make sound? | Settled by the existing prototype for now (canvas; the browser's own audio); revisit only if the move shows a reason |
| Which MEI elements does the roll handle first? | Notes, rests, ties and several staves first; list the rest as known gaps |
